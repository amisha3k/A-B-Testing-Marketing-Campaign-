# ðŸ“Š A/B Testing Project  

This notebook focuses on analyzing the performance of **Facebook Ads** and **AdWords campaigns** using real-world marketing data.  
The goal is to compare the two platforms in terms of **views, clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness**.  

By applying statistical testing and regression models, we aim to answer the following key questions:  
- Which platform drives **higher conversion rates**?  
- Which one is **more cost-efficient**?  
- Are the differences in performance **statistically significant**?

## ðŸ”Ž Project Workflow  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values and inconsistent data types  
   - Convert currency and percentage columns into numerical values for analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generate descriptive statistics for Facebook and AdWords campaigns  
   - Visualize ad views, clicks, conversions, and costs using bar plots and histograms  
   - Compare distribution patterns between the two platforms  

3. **Hypothesis Testing (A/B Testing)**  
   - Perform **t-tests** to compare conversion rates between Facebook Ads and AdWords  
   - Determine whether observed differences are statistically significant at a 5% confidence level  

4. **Regression Analysis**  
   - Build a **Linear Regression model** to analyze the relationship between ad views, clicks, and conversions  
   - Evaluate model performance using **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
   - Interpret coefficients to understand the impact of different features on conversion rates

âœ… This structured approach ensures that the insights derived from the dataset are **statistically valid, data-driven, and actionable** for making marketing decisions.
